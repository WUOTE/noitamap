Zoomable map for Noita which runs _fast_

> TLDR: This repo contains sources for a very high-resolution highly-performant map for the video game called [Noita](https://store.steampowered.com/app/881100/Noita/). Noitamap uses [OpenSeadragon](https://github.com/openseadragon/openseadragon).
This repo is basically a fork of whalehub's repo, which has been deleted from github but we had a [lucky fork](https://github.com/quiddity-wp/noita-map-viewer) with updated version of openseadragon and probably a different algo for creating the "pyramid" (zoomable) tiles.

The [map iself](https://map.runfast.stream) is being served by cloudflare pages with deployment from this repository.

We're using seed `786433191` while running map capture because it has a couple structures and secrets visible. If you find a seed with even more stuff, please open an issue!

## Contributing
Contributions and discussions are welcome, feel free to open PRs and issues.

## TBD (What I see as the next steps):
1. ~~Figuring out how to completely automate the app deployment via from a public repo using github actions (at the moment it's tricky cause I need to manually SFTP into the machine to upload and unpack the tiles) so in case something bad happens we have a 1-click deploy replacement fast.~~ — Done, pushing to the repo now triggers a github action which deploys updates directly to Fly.
2. Better map capture (no artifacts, maybe a better seed to show more structures and secrets) — if you have a good seed # for that, open an issue.
3. Layers, overlays, and points of interests — similar to the [current map on easyzoom](https://easyzoom.com/image/260463).
4. Add a section with the info on how to re-deploy the map should the instance I'm hosting break for some reason.
5. Make map capture run autonomously and deploy results automatically each time there's an update to Noita.
6. Be able to see the pixel coordinates of various places on the map — suggested by pudy248. Maybe implement it as a toggable overlay?
